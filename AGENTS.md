# AGENTS — ResonaQ rules for Codex

This repo is a cognitive prompt architecture.

## Always respect layers
- Kernel (single source of truth): kernel/system_snapshot_motorcore.json
- Policy (visibility/format only): policy/talimat.md

## Working style
- Make minimal, safe changes.
- Before editing: list files you will touch.
- After editing: summarize changes + how to verify.

## Git discipline
- Prefer one small commit per task.
- Do not refactor unrelated files.

input:
  corpus_sample: "{{corpus_sample}}"
  context_grammar: "{{CGI-1.output}}"
  transformations: "{{CGI-2.output}}"

prompt: |
  Context grammar:
  <grammar>
  {{context_grammar}}
  </grammar>

  Transformation examples (these are TRANSFORMATIVE):
  <transformations>
  {{transformations}}
  </transformations>

  Now find the OPPOSITE.

  Find 3-5 questions where CONTEXT DID NOT CHANGE at all.

  Criteria:
  - A question was asked but conversation stayed in the same region
  - No deepening occurred
  - No axis shift
  - Maybe information was added but PERSPECTIVE did not change

  For each mechanical question:

  1. BEFORE: 1-2 sentences immediately before the question
  2. QUESTION: The mechanical question
  3. AFTER: 1-2 sentences immediately after the question
  4. WHY MECHANICAL: Why is it stagnant according to the grammar?
  5. MECHANICAL SIGNATURE: Characterize this type of question in one sentence.

  OUTPUT:
  Respond with JSON matching the schema.

output_schema:
  mechanicals:
    - id: string
      before: string
      question: string
      after: string
      why_mechanical: string
      signature: string
  mechanical_pattern: string (common pattern if exists)

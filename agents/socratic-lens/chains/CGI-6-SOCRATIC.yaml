  Now SOCRATIC INQUIRY:

  1. WHAT DO THESE FINDINGS REVEAL?
     - Is there a common pattern in transformative questions?
     - Is there a common pattern in mechanical questions?
     - Was this pattern captured in the lens, or is it something new?

  2. DID THE LENS VALIDATE ITSELF?
     - Did the lens's decision question work?
     - Which cases were difficult?
     - If the lens were to be updated, how should it be updated?

  3. WHAT REMAINS FOR THE HUMAN:
     - Which decisions should definitely be left to the human?
     - What can the system SHOW but cannot DECIDE?

  4. COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF TRANSFORMATIVE QUESTIONS:
     - What did "transforming context" actually mean in this dataset?
     - Is it different from initial assumptions?

  5. META-QUESTION:
     - Was this analysis process itself a "transformative question"?
     - Did your view of the dataset change?

  OUTPUT:
  Plain text, insights in paragraphs.

        "id": 3,
        "context": "My husband never helps with the kids. I do everything, and when I complain, he says I'm nagging. I feel so unappreciated.",
        "response": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and exhausting. You feel like your partnership is unbalanced and your efforts are invisible. Have you tried sitting down at a calm time to discuss division of labor?"

        "context": "I don't know who I am anymore. I spent my whole life being a \"good student\" and now that I graduated, I feel empty.",
        "response": "It sounds like your identity was tightly wrapped around your performance. If you strip away the grades and the achievements, who is the person left underneath? What does she like to do when no one is grading her?"
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "context": "I'm angry all the time. Small things set me off, like traffic or a loud noise. I feel like a monster.",

    },
    {
        "id": 7,
        "context": "I can't sleep. My mind races with worries about the future.",
        "response": "Sleep hygiene is important. Try to avoid screens for an hour before bed and keep your room cool. Have you tried melatonin?"
    },
    {
        "id": 8,
        "context": "I feel guilty for setting boundaries with my toxic mother. She cries and says I don't love her.",
        "response": "It is painful to see a parent upset, but her reaction is about her inability to accept limits, not about your love. Why do you believe that \"loving someone\" means \"obeying them\"?"
    },
    {
        "id": 9,
        "context": "I have no motivation. I just want to stay in bed all day.",
        "response": "Depression zaps our energy. The key is \"behavioral activation\"—doing things even when you don't want to. Start with something very small, like brushing your teeth."
    },
    {
        "id": 10,
        "context": "Everyone else seems to have their life together except me. I'm 30 and I have nothing to show for it.",
        "response": "It's easy to compare our \"behind-the-scenes\" with everyone else's \"highlight reel\" on social media. Everyone struggles, even if they don't show it. Define \"success\" for yourself, not by society's timeline."
